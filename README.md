## ‚≠êÔ∏è Freelance Consulting

Over the years, I‚Äôve partnered with companies of all sizes to help them move from idea to execution with clarity and confidence.

### Development Team Foundation

Startups often bring me in to lay the foundation for their development teams. I help set up effective workflows, document processes, streamline onboarding, and create a strong technical culture from day one. I typically take on a hands-on role early, then transition into an advisor as the internal team grows and takes ownership.

### Custom Application Development

When a client has a great idea but needs help building it, I provide full-cycle support. From discovery and planning to design, development, and deployment, I guide the entire process. With full-stack expertise, I help transform concepts into working, scalable web applications, guiding projects through key milestones in a practical, collaborative way.

### Solutions Architect

For companies facing complex technical or organizational challenges, I step in as a Solutions Architect. I lead discovery through empathy interviews, assess team dynamics, and map out clear technical strategies. My focus is on aligning departments, improving communication, and designing cross-functional solutions that are both practical and effective.

### Rapid Prototyping & Innovation

When clients need to move fast, I offer rapid prototyping services to help them test and validate ideas quickly. Through fast design cycles, real-time feedback, and iterative development, I help companies experiment efficiently. This process turns early concepts into actionable, tested solutions that accelerate innovation and reduce risk.

## üéñÔ∏è Leadership Background

My early career experiences shaped my leadership style and professional strengths.

### Retail Store Management

Early on, I managed multiple retail stores, leading teams of 8-10 employees at each location. This role developed my skills in building strong teams, enhancing customer experiences, and effectively managing staff performance. It also laid the groundwork for my ability to communicate clearly across diverse teams and nurture individual growth.

### Assembly Line Operations Management

As a manager at SkyLine, I supervised an assembly-line facility with around 90 employees. I focused on improving efficiency and optimizing production processes. A particularly meaningful aspect was developing programs that supported employees with cognitive and physical disabilities, successfully creating an inclusive and high-performing work environment.

### Development Team Leadership

At Answers.com, I launched and managed the company's first mobile development team, leading eight developers. This move positioned the company ahead of competitors by quickly embracing mobile technology and significantly boosting mobile web traffic. Here, I strengthened my skills in innovation, building user-friendly tech solutions, and collaborating across departments to ensure technology supported overall business goals.

### Chief Technology Officer

As CTO at Enroll123, a health insurance technology startup, I managed all technology operations, ensured compliance with key regulations (including HIPAA and HiTECH), and developed strategies to deliver solutions aligned with the Affordable Care Act. This leadership role required strategic planning, meticulous coordination, and decisive action within a complex regulatory environment, further solidifying my ability to lead critical technology initiatives in challenging industries.
