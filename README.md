## üéñÔ∏è Leadership

My earliest career experiences have significantly shaped my leadership approach and capabilities.

### Retail Store Management

Early in my career, I managed multiple retail locations‚Äîincluding Jarman, Journeys, Bakers, and Gadzooks‚Äîeach team consisting of 8-10 associates. This role honed my abilities in team building, operational excellence, customer experience optimization, and performance management, creating foundational skills in cross-functional communication and personnel development.

### Assembly Line Operations Management

As Manager at SkyLine, I led an assembly-line facility with approximately 90 team members. My responsibilities included optimizing production workflows and ensuring operational efficiency. A unique aspect of this role involved implementing programs to train and support employees with disabilities‚Äîboth cognitive and physical‚Äîsuccessfully fostering an inclusive workplace and integrating diverse talent into high-performing teams.

### Mobile Development Team Leadership

At Answers.com, I established and led the company's first mobile development team, directly managing eight developers. This strategic initiative significantly enhanced the company‚Äôs early adaptation to mobile technologies, enabling rapid growth in mobile web traffic. This role strengthened my capability to innovate, build technology solutions, and collaborate cross-departmentally to align technology initiatives with overall business objectives.

### Chief Technology Officer

As CTO of Enroll123, a health insurance technology startup, I oversaw all technological operations, compliance initiatives (including HIPAA and HiTECH standards), and development strategies to effectively integrate Affordable Care Act solutions for health providers. My role required extensive coordination, strategic planning, and decisive leadership in a highly regulated environment, cementing my capability to lead high-impact technology initiatives within complex industries.
